// piping.flow - Piping/chaining example

to twice n:
    return n * 2

to square n:
    return n * n

to start:
    // Basic piping: value | function
    result is 5 | twice
    say result

    // Chained piping: 5 | twice | square = square(twice(5)) = square(10) = 100
    chained is 5 | twice | square
    say chained

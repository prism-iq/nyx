to add a and b:
    return a + b

to multiply a and b:
    return a * b

test "addition works":
    result is add 2 and 3
    assert result == 5, "2 + 3 should equal 5"
    assert add 0 and 0 == 0, "0 + 0 should equal 0"

test "multiplication works":
    result is multiply 3 and 4
    assert result == 12, "3 * 4 should equal 12"
    assert multiply 0 and 100 == 0, "0 * anything should be 0"

to start:
    say "Running tests..."
    // Tests are compiled as separate functions
    say "All tests defined - run with test runner"
